# Neovim Dotfiles, basically

I ended up forking [CosmicNvim](https://github.com/CosmicNvim/CosmicNvim) cos I got fed up of various things not working together in my own setup. Turns out nothing ever really works as you'd want it to with Neovim so you end up endlessly tweaking any way. So CosmicNvim then turned into my own version of that. A bit stripped back, and then bulked up again with different stuff.

#### Prerequisites

- Neovim (+0.8.1)

- [prettierd](https://github.com/fsouza/prettierd) (for prettier formatting w/null_ls, optional)
